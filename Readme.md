# __Objective: create .sh and .bat files__
## __Batch file__
#### They do the following: The batch (bash) file receives 2 relative paths to folders (as batch file parameters). 
 #### If a certain folder hasn't been found, it will have written "This folder hasn't found - [Set_Path]" and have completed the fulfilling this program. 
#### *You can see screens below how this part of program works. As an example I have taken two paths such as "C:\Lbr1" and "C:\Lbr2"*

#### So if all certain folders have found, batch (bash) file will move into the first folder and check out on amount of files with txt expansion in it. If even one file has been found, it will continue the fulfilling, else it will have written the message "There is no .txt files" and have completed the fulfilling of this program. 
#### *You can see a screenshot as a proof of working.*

#### When it has been found .txt file(files), it will set an attribute only reading for them and for files with other expansions. As you can see, I have an attribute "R" for these files. After this it will have moved .txt file into the second folder along the second path. All .txt files have been moved into the second path and others stayed in the first folder.
